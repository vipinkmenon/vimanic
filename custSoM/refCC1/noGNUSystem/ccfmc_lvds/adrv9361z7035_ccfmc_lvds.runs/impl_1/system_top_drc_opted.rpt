2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP i_system_wrapper/system_i/AMModulate/amModulator_0/inst/scaledBaseband input i_system_wrapper/system_i/AMModulate/amModulator_0/inst/scaledBaseband/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP i_system_wrapper/system_i/AMModulate/amModulator_0/inst/scaledBaseband input i_system_wrapper/system_i/AMModulate/amModulator_0/inst/scaledBaseband/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#3 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP i_system_wrapper/system_i/AMModulate/amModulator_0/inst/tmp3 input i_system_wrapper/system_i/AMModulate/amModulator_0/inst/tmp3/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#4 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP i_system_wrapper/system_i/AMModulate/amModulator_0/inst/tmp3 input i_system_wrapper/system_i/AMModulate/amModulator_0/inst/tmp3/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#5 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP i_system_wrapper/system_i/AMModulate/amModulator_0/inst/tmp3 input i_system_wrapper/system_i/AMModulate/amModulator_0/inst/tmp3/C[47:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP i_system_wrapper/system_i/AMModulate/amModulator_0/inst/scaledBaseband output i_system_wrapper/system_i/AMModulate/amModulator_0/inst/scaledBaseband/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP i_system_wrapper/system_i/AMModulate/amModulator_0/inst/tmp3 output i_system_wrapper/system_i/AMModulate/amModulator_0/inst/tmp3/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP i_system_wrapper/system_i/AMModulate/amModulator_0/inst/scaledBaseband multiplier stage i_system_wrapper/system_i/AMModulate/amModulator_0/inst/scaledBaseband/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#2 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP i_system_wrapper/system_i/AMModulate/amModulator_0/inst/tmp3 multiplier stage i_system_wrapper/system_i/AMModulate/amModulator_0/inst/tmp3/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

NDRV-5#1 Warning
DriverAndLoadless Nets  
Undriven nets found. Running opt_design will clean up the undriven nets from your design. Please ensure that opt_design has been run on your design and check the remaining
nets for DONT_TOUCH properties. The undriven nets in your design are: Bus Net i_system_wrapper/system_i/AMDemodulate/i_data_1[11:0] has undriven and unloaded bits 0:11.
Related violations: <none>
